- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve
- 👀 I’m interested in home and boat automation and sensors. Building and networking smart devices to measure an environment, respond to it and graph the sensor data. I do a lot of work with domestic heating systems, but also like to mess around with electronics project on my small sailing yacht.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python on the Rasberry PI Pico (Micropython).
- 💞️ I’m currently focusing on Pico Boat Assistant [https://github.com/sjefferson99/BoatMan-Py](https://github.com/sjefferson99/pico-boat-assistant)
