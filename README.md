- 👋 Hi, I’m Steve
- 👀 I’m interested in home and boat automation and sensors. Building and networking smart devices to measure an environment, respond to it and graph the sensor data. I do a lot of work with domestic heating systems, but also like to mess around with electronics project on my small sailing yacht.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python, Django, Rasberry PI Pico (Micropython) and I2C bus
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Boatman https://github.com/sjefferson99/BoatMan-Py
